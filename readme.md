# Responsiveness Project

In this project I created a responsive portfolio which includes a home page (index.html), a contact page, and a portfolio page.&nbsp; I got to utilize media screen tags on my html pages to make them viewable on different devices.&nbsp; The viewport meta tag is included on each html page to ensure it can be viewed on all devices. The buttons on the navbar make it easy to navigate from one page to the next.
